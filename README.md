This project is guided by Dr.Yao Ming Chang, Dr. Guey Shin Wang, and mentor Pei Ei Wu from Academia Sinica Institute of Biomedical Science, Taiwan.

Atrophy or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum is commonly seen in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 brain, which is strongly associated with cognitive deficits and executive functions. In this project, we utilize public databases and references (Manno et al., 2021) to identify different cell type clusters through differential expression gene (DEGs) and trajectory lineage analysis using R. We selected five key time points—E10, E11, E12.5, E13.5, and E15.5—that represent peak stages of corpus callosum development to examine how cell clusters change over time.
