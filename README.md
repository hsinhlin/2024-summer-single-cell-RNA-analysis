## Identification of the population of susceptible progenitors/neurons by Single-cell RNA sequencing
This project is guided by Dr. Guey Shin Wang, Dr. Yao Ming Chang, mentor Pei Ei Wu, and other Dr. Chang's lab members from the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS), Academia Sinica, Taiwan.

Atrophy or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum is commonly seen in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 brain, which is strongly associated with cognitive deficits and executive functions. In this project, we utilize public databases and references (Manno et al., 2021) to identify different cell type clusters through differential expression gene (DEGs) and trajectory lineage analysis using R. We selected five key time points—E10, E11, E12.5, E13.5, and E15.5—that represent peak stages of corpus callosum development to examine how cell clusters change over time.
